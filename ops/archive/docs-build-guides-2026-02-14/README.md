# Archived Build-Focused Documentation

This directory preserves the previous internal build/design guide set that formerly lived in `docs/`.

Date archived: 2026-02-14

## Why this exists

`docs/` is now reserved for canonical, user-facing documentation.

Historical implementation-focused guides were moved here so they remain available for internal reference without mixing internal design history into end-user docs.

## Contents

- `architecture/` — prior architecture planning docs
- `design/` — prior implementation and operational semantics docs
- `overview/` — prior vision/principles/PRD/quickstart draft set
