Love that timing. A landing page **now** will actually sharpen the product, not distract from it — because it forces you to say *what this is* in human language.

Below is **landing-page content you can basically paste in**, structured section by section. It’s opinionated, calm, and serious — not hypey AI fluff.

You can tweak tone later, but this captures the **core mission and philosophy** you’ve been building.

# HERO

### **Hivemind**

**Agentic development you can actually trust.**

Hivemind is a local-first orchestration system for AI agents that work on real codebases — with full observability, explicit control, and human authority at every critical boundary.

No magic.
No black boxes.
No surprise merges.

**→ Build with agents, without losing control.**

# SUBHERO / ONE-LINER CLARITY

> Most AI coding tools optimize for speed.
> **Hivemind optimizes for correctness, safety, and trust.**

# THE PROBLEM

### AI agents are powerful — and dangerous

Today’s AI coding tools:

* Modify your code in opaque ways
* Hide context and reasoning
* Break when things go wrong
* Collapse under parallelism
* Assume you’ll clean up the mess

They work great…
**until they don’t.**

And when they fail, you’re left guessing:

* What changed?
* Why did it change?
* Can I undo this safely?
* Can I trust it next time?

---

# THE INSIGHT

### The problem isn’t intelligence — it’s orchestration

Agents don’t fail because they’re “not smart enough”.
They fail because they operate without:

* Clear boundaries
* Deterministic execution
* Explicit verification
* Replayable state
* Human governance

Hivemind fixes that.

# WHAT IS HIVEMIND?

### A control plane for agentic development

Hivemind is **not**:

* a chatbot
* an IDE replacement
* a model host

Hivemind **is**:

* a task orchestration system
* a safety layer over agent execution
* an event-driven engine for AI-assisted development

It coordinates agents the same way serious systems coordinate services:
with plans, state, events, and rules.

---

# CORE PRINCIPLES (THIS SECTION MATTERS)

### Built on non-negotiable principles

**Observability is truth**
If it happened, you can see it. If you can’t see it, it didn’t happen.

**Explicit structure beats implicit magic**
Tasks, scopes, retries, merges — nothing is assumed.

**Human authority at critical boundaries**
Agents can work fast. Humans decide what ships.

**Local-first, tool-agnostic**
Your code stays on your machine. Use the runtimes you already trust.

**Replaceable intelligence, stable system**
Models change. Architectures shouldn’t break.

---

# HOW IT WORKS (HIGH LEVEL)

### Agent execution, done properly

1. **Plan**

   * Tasks and dependencies are defined up front
   * Parallelism is explicit and safe

2. **Execute**

   * Agents run in isolated, scoped environments
   * Every action emits events

3. **Verify**

   * Automated checks + verifier agents
   * Bounded retries — no infinite loops

4. **Review & Merge**

   * Clean diffs
   * Explicit approvals
   * No surprise commits

Everything is inspectable. Everything is reversible.

---

# KEY FEATURES (NOT FLUFF)

### Designed for real-world development

**TaskFlows (not prompts)**
Deterministic execution plans instead of ad-hoc chats.

**Scoped parallel agents**
Run agents in parallel without stepping on each other.

**Checkpointed execution**
Incremental commits for diffs, undo, and retries.

**Event-native architecture**
Pause, resume, replay, debug — by design.

**CLI-first interface**
If it works, it works headlessly. The UI is just a projection.

**Runtime adapters**
Use Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini — or swap later.

---

# WHO IS THIS FOR?

### Built for developers who care about correctness

Hivemind is for:

* Solo developers building serious systems
* Engineers tired of “AI magic” they can’t debug
* People who want speed *and* safety
* Anyone who believes AI should be governed, not trusted blindly

If you’re happy with autocomplete and demos, this isn’t for you.

# DIFFERENTIATION (IMPORTANT)

### How Hivemind is different

| Typical AI tools   | Hivemind                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Prompt → code      | Plan → execute → verify |
| Hidden context     | Explicit state          |
| One-shot execution | Bounded retries         |
| Opaque diffs       | First-class diffs       |
| Fast demos         | Safe systems            |

---

# FUTURE VISION (CALM, NOT GRANDIOSE)

### A system that can improve itself

Because everything is exposed via the CLI:

* Agents can inspect failures
* Agents can retry safely
* Agents can operate Hivemind itself

Hivemind isn’t just agent-friendly.
It’s **agent-operable**.

---

# CALL TO ACTION

### Build with agents. Stay in control.

Hivemind is currently under active development.

If you care about:

* trust
* correctness
* observability
* and real-world workflows

then you’re already part of the audience.

# OPTIONAL FOOTER LINE (I LIKE THIS)

> *Hivemind is not an AI that writes code.*
> *It’s a system that makes agentic work legible, governable, and real.*

If you want, next I can:

* tighten this into a **shorter, punchier version**
* adapt it for **GitHub README vs marketing site**
* help you design the **visual metaphors** (graphs, timelines, execution flows)
* or write a **“Why we built this” essay** to anchor the project philosophically

This landing page will *absolutely* attract the right kind of people.
